            As an eight-year-old in the 90s, I started building websites and learning how to program C++. Since then, I have earned over a decade of professional tech experience and over two decades of total dev experience, including spending three years as Chief Technology Officer of a Y Combinator-backed startup.

            Since a young age, I have also had a love of writing, both fiction and non. In 2017, I was <Link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/opinion/twitter-transgender-harassment-problem.html">featured in the New York Times</Link> talking about anti-trans harassment on Twitter. As part of smol farm, I am the lead writer of the <Link href="https://smol.news">smol farm Substack</Link>, which discusses everything from the technology to duck egg farming.
